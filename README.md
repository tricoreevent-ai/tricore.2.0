# TriCore Events

TriCore Events is a full-stack sports event operations platform for corporate tournaments. It replaces ad-hoc spreadsheets, chat-based coordination, and manual payment follow-up with a single application for event publishing, registrations, payment proof review, scheduling, accounting, reporting, contact forwarding, and admin operations.

For a single list of non-theme functional changes, see [docs/FEATURE_CHANGELOG.md](docs/FEATURE_CHANGELOG.md).

## Core Data Models

- `User`: Google users, local admin users, payout details, and login metadata
- `Event`: tournament definition, schedule window, fee, team size, and registration settings
- `Registration`: team/contact/player roster for an event
- `Payment`: free, manual, or Razorpay payment record with proof metadata and confirmation data
- `Match`: scheduled fixtures and generated knockout rounds
- `Transaction`: income/expense ledger row with event/common scope and reference document
- `AppSetting`: DB-backed configuration for email, contact forwarding, and payment settings
- `ContactInquiry`: public contact form submissions and forwarding state

## Payment and Registration Workflow

### Free Event
1. User signs in with Google.
2. User opens an event and enters team plus player details.
3. `POST /api/registrations` creates a `Confirmed` registration with a `free` payment record.
4. Notification emails are sent for the registration.

### Paid Event with Manual Proof
1. User signs in with Google.
2. User fills team and player details.
3. Client stores the registration draft and redirects to `/events/:eventId/payment`.
4. Payment page loads configured QR, UPI, and bank details from `/api/payment-settings`.
5. User uploads a payment screenshot.
6. `POST /api/registrations/manual` creates:
   - registration status `Registered`
   - payment status `Under Review` when proof is attached
7. Admin reviews the registration and proof in the Registrations screen.
8. Admin confirms payment from `/api/registrations/:id/confirm-payment`.
9. The system updates:
   - registration status to `Confirmed`
   - payment status to `Confirmed`
   - accounting ledger with an auto registration income transaction
10. Confirmation email is sent to the team with player names and event dates.

### Paid Event with Razorpay
1. User requests `/api/create-order`.
2. Client completes checkout.
3. Client sends payment result to `/api/verify-payment`.
4. Server verifies the signature, creates the registration, and records confirmed income.

## Schedule Workflow

1. Only admins can create or generate matches.
2. Schedule management loads confirmed teams from `/api/matches/event/:eventId/confirmed-teams`.
3. Manual match creation rejects unconfirmed teams.
4. Knockout generation creates bracket rounds until a final is reached.
5. Public event pages and user dashboard display published matches.

## Accounting Transaction Model

- `income`
- `expense`

### Transaction Sources

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies from the repo root:
   - `npm install`
2. Start frontend and backend together:
   - `npm run dev`
3. Frontend default URL:
   - `http://localhost:5173`
4. Backend default URL:
   - `http://localhost:5000`

## Hostinger Deployment

Use the Hostinger deployment guide in [docs/HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT.md](/c:/Works/Tricore%202.0/docs/HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT.md).

- Recommended Node.js version: `22.x`
- Recommended build command: `npm run hostinger:build`
- Recommended start command: `npm run hostinger:start`
- Recommended server env template: [server/.env.hostinger.example](/c:/Works/Tricore%202.0/server/.env.hostinger.example)
- Recommended client build env template: [client/.env.hostinger.example](/c:/Works/Tricore%202.0/client/.env.hostinger.example)

### Windows Helpers
- [run-app.bat](/c:/Works/Tricore/run-app.bat)
- [deploy-app.bat](/c:/Works/Tricore/deploy-app.bat)
- [build-deploy.bat](/c:/Works/Tricore/build-deploy.bat)

## Default Admin Access

The server bootstraps a local admin account if it does not already exist.

- Username: `tricore`
- Password: `tricore`
- Admin portal route: `/admin-portal/login`

## Validation and Test Assets

### Automated Validation Suite
The repository includes a repeatable validation script that:
- creates a dedicated paid validation event
- creates validation users and registrations
- submits manual payment proof
- confirms payments as admin
- seeds 20 manual accounting transactions
- validates update, delete, dashboard, report, and scheduling flows

Run it from the repo root:

```bash
npm run validate:workflow
```

The suite requires the backend API to be running on `http://localhost:5000` unless `VALIDATION_API_URL` is set.

### Workflow Test Document
Detailed manual and automated test procedures are documented in [docs/WORKFLOW_TEST_PLAN.md](/c:/Works/Tricore/docs/WORKFLOW_TEST_PLAN.md).

## Operational Notes

- Email settings and contact forwarding settings are DB-backed and automatically fall back to `.env` defaults.
- Payment settings are DB-backed.
- Duplicate registrations are blocked by event and email, and by event and team name.
- Manual accounting transactions can be edited or deleted. Payment-generated transactions cannot.
- Match generation uses confirmed teams only.
- Soft-deleted events are hidden from normal event listing.
